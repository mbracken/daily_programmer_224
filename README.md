# daily_programmer_224

This file was a Python script used to solve the Reddit Daily Programmer 224 Intermediate (http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3e5b0o/20150722_challenge_224_intermediate_detecting/)
The script will open one of the test files which contain ASCII characters that portray a set of lines and squares and the script will determine how
many unique 4 sided complete squares can be found in the shape.




#Files include the Python script entitled "pyscripts" and 4 test files containing shapes
testing.txt - 25 rectangles
testing2.txt - 25 rectangles
testing3.txt - 3977 
testing4.txt - 79499

For the testing file to be changed it will need to be changed in the script before running.
